# Twitch Extension

## Setup Guide

### Twitch Username

To use the "Following Channels" Feature or the menu-bar "Live Followed Channels" Feature, you need to provide a Twitch Username in the Raycast Extension preferences.

You can find yours on Twitch directly:
- Go to [your settings page](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/profile)
- Under "Profile Settings"
- There is an item called "Username", this is what you are looking for.
